# Nira

**Nira** is an offline-first complaint registration and tracking platform designed for environments with limited or unreliable internet connectivity.

It enables users to submit complaints using voice, text, or images and automatically sync them when a connection is available. The system intelligently routes complaints to the appropriate department and provides transparent status tracking.
